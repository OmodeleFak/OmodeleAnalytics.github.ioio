									<h2><a href="https://github.com/OmodeleFak/business_analysis/blob/main/Tesca.sql">ETL pipeline scripting for Implementation of EDW Architecture<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>This project involves ETL Pipeline Scripting for a grocery chain business with stores in many cities in the various provinces.<br />
										The tasks implemented include: creation of staging database and the Enterprise Data Warehourse (EDW); extraction of data from
										heterogeneous sources (OLTP and CSV); and transformation according to business rules.<br />
										In denormalizing source data, some extractions were simply done by joining data from different tables,<br />
										and others were done with stored procedure using T-SQL. </p>
								</header>
								<a href="https://github.com/OmodeleFak/business_analysis/blob/main/Tesca.sql" class="image main"><img src="images/Grocery Chain.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>With this scripting done, the process of using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to perform data migration becomes a plug-and-play task. This process
									and sequence of the migration would then be controlled for efficiency.

										</a></h2>
										<p>This project involves the use of T-SQL to dynamically populate multiple transactional tables. To test the flow
											of data from the various entities into the transaction tables: conceptual, logical and physical tables were created
											with entities as required by the business stakeholders; SQL and T-SQL scripts was written for the process connecting And
											populating the required entities; and a stored procedure was created for the processes for optimization.<br />

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/OmodeleFak/Titanic_Classifications/blob/main/classification.py">Machine Learning Exploration: Predicting Titanic Survival with Various Classification Models<br />
										</a></h2>
										<p>This analysis involve the infamous Titanic dataset, which records the tragic events of April 15, 1912, when the ship sank, resulting in the loss
											of 1502 lives out of 2224 passengers and crew members. My objective is to employ various classifier models to predict the likelihood of Survival
											(with "Survived" as the label) based on the key attributes including "Pclass", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Sex" and "Embarked".<br />					
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/OmodeleFak/Titanic_Classifications/blob/main/classification.py" class="image fit"><img src="images/titanic.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> While the accuracies of classifier algorithms are the same for Random Forest (0.80), Support Vector Mechanism (0.80) and KNN (0.80),
										it is a little different with Logistic Regression (0.75) and Gradient Boosting (0.79). Within the context of survival prediction, precision and
										f1-scores are of greater importance to minimize false positives. Hence, Support Vector Mechanism with precision and f1-score of 83% and 74% respectively, for 
										survival prediction is the most suitable amongst the types of classifiers employed.

											well-known incidents. To slice and dice the data, dashboards are configured such that actionable insights can be deduced in each case.<br />

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/OmodeleFak/SQF_DataExploration/blob/main/exploration.py">Cleaning and exploration of the Stop, Question and Frisk (SQF) Data
												with Python<br />
										</a></h2>
										<p>The exercise here involves the exploration and cleaning of the SQF 2012 data with Python. With over 100 columns, the tasks here were conducted with select 
											attributes. The process involved the use of Python libraries such as Folium, tqdm, openpyxl, pyproject, seaborn and many more. Some of the cleaning done 
											include conversion of height to centimeter from feet, excluding unrealistic ages such as toddlers, removing some outliers and coercing a few others.
											And some of the explorations done include distribution check for age, weight, height and gender. Type of force applied, police identification and lot 
											more were explored. The dataset can be assessed by clicking on the image. <br />
